Battery and camera quality is phenomenal and met the expectations.  Unfortunately the Amazon promise on zero cost EMI is misleading. I opted for 6 months EMI considering zero percent interest. But HDFC bank charged me around 12% interest plus GST etc. This is like taking customer for a ride.  I was surprised to receive a msg like that from bank. Just to alert Amazon to rectify this immediately.\n\n  \n"},

The picture quality of a13 Megapixel camera phone is like a photo clicked by 2MP camera..Overall phone is good built...BUT DONT GO FOR BUYING IF YOU LOVE PHOTOGRAPHY and even if know a bit of technical stuff i.e Mega pixels\n\n  \n"}
