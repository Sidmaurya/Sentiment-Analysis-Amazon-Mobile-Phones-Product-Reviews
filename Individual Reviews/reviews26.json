As clearly seen in the photo. OnePlus 8 pro has some serious issues with its display. To reproduce the issue, you have to sit in a dark room with the lowest brightness possible in your device.\n\n  \n"},

The design is top-notch. The punch hole camera does not spoil the overall screen experience as some people have said. Very sleek and premium looking design-wise. The battery life does not last really long when you use it on 120 Hz QHD+, although it's quite manageable and can get through the day with mid usage easily. Coming to gaming, I'm a hardcore gamer and can game continuously for 3-4 hours, and let me tell you this phone can run through it with ease. I've played PUBG quite a lot on this device and have not noticed any major frame drops at HDR graphics and Extreme frame rates, let alone Smooth graphics. It runs PUBG really smoothly. Stable frames at all times. I would suggest it for competitive PUBG and other games too. The 120 Hz Amoled screen is breathtaking. Buttery smooth at all times. Certainly the best display on a phone. I have found the cameras to be decent enough. Nothing too fancy, nor a let down. Videos are very stable though. This has come close to the iPhone cameras as a video shooter. This might even offer better stabilization than the iPhone videos. The colour filter camera is disabled out of the box. Speakers are fairly loud and clear. A very good surround experience. You'll find a Dolby sample video in your gallery. Play it on the phone speakers and see for yourself.Here comes the bad part about it. The phone that I had received, I used it for about 2 weeks and discovered it had this image retention issue. The afterimage of anything displayed for a period of time on the phone for a long time is displayed on the screen even after the original image is pulled off. This could be seen while watching Youtube videos in non-fill screen mode or videos that have any kind of frame visible or even games like PUBG where static elements of game like the map's frame or your controls would be visible on certain background colours even after you have turned the game off. I had reset the phone and not seen any kind of improvement. I checked on the community and many people have experienced this issue as well. The hole-punch band issue is there but it was very vague and DC dimming could fix it. Also, my screen had no green tints. The image retention issue could easily turn into permanent screen burns really soon. So, I have returned my product for now and plan to buy the same phone again.Hope you people find this review useful. Not a very organized review but that's what I have experienced.\n\n  \n"},

Phone always stay warm unless you sit in AC room.It heats a lot even during normal usage.During charging its heat a lot .Front camera of this phone is Just pathetic.In whatsapp video call is worse. Slight background light fades away all the details.Even with default camera app,the front camera is bad. Back camera is decent.First time i am disappointed with OnePlus.I think reviews are just hype.\n\n  \n"},
