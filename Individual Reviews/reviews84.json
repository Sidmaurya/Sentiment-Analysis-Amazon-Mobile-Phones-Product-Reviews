Even after upgrading the ios to 12.0.1, there seems to be no difference, I think the screen could have been used to fit in more text compared to the Xs. having said that, im used to big phones, the Pixel 2xl, the 6sPlus, so if you are a big phone person, go for this phone with eyes closed.If you are confused between apple and android flagships, let me tell you, I was on HTC for 3 years, then shifted to iphone 6s plus for 3 years and briefly shifted to pixel 2 xl, and  now finally to Xs Max, which I intend to use for the next 3 years. having used both, I definitely feel iphones are quite premium and offer the best tech. I mean when I think about it, who invented face ID? who designed the notch? Almost all phones come with these features these days and after adapting to iphones technology, the other phones are going a step ahead, so definitely, apple is the trend setter! Comparing pixel 2xl with Xs Max, I found that the pixel 2 xl and even the pixel 2 get damn hot, definitely not the issue on the iphone. Iphone looks much better too! GREAT DISPLAY! Also great touch interface! its really smooth. Having said that, Its all personal choice!I really love my purchase! and now I know why some people are reluctant to switch to android from iphone!\n\n  \n"},

For the record, Apple will support this phone with software updates for 5 years...the Note 9 is a 2018 phone running 2017 Android software and Samsung gives software updates for 3 years. I\u2019ll list some pros and cons and also what the tech media won\u2019t tell you.Pros:- battery life is all day- upgraded speakers get real loud- Face ID is faster- fast and smooth- Siri has been given shortcuts- upgraded cameras are just as good as Samsung cameras now and the front camera is better than the Note 9 front cameraCons:- expensive- slow speed charger- no headphone jack- it\u2019s made of glass on the front and back. A case is almost mandatory especially if you are clumsyBottom line...the iPhone and Galaxy phones are the best phones on the market right now. The iPhone is a step ahead because iOS gets frequent updates and starting with iOS 12 Apple actually sped up old iPhones and iPads which will allow users to keep their devices longer. An iPhone is now like a laptop and something you only need to upgrade once it breaks. The iPhone is also the ONLY smartphone that can stream all video apps in full screen. Android doesn\u2019t have full screen built into the OS so video apps like HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, STARZ, Encore, and EPIC are all tiny on the Note 9...those apps are all full screen on the iPhone. Food for thought.\n\n  \n"},

Had gone through blogs and there was hope that it be a software issue and will get fixed. But unfortunately 2 months are over and even with the latest iOS 12.1.2, vibration function not working. I work in Nigeria and now do not know how to get it replaced.\n\n  \n"},

Excellent speed and battery life and everyone knows about camera quality. No doubt those who can\u2019t afford it will never have a chance to use this phone. These people are everywhere crying out loud about price tag, but once you buy it and use it you will know it\u2019s worth. Amazon is excellent in delivering packages securely to customers.\n\n  \n"}
