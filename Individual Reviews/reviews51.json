After lots of research with around 30K budget initially i wanted to go for K20 Pro but have been using MI phones for last 4 years so it seemed only hardware upgrade with everything feeling same. After research i finally decided to buy this phone and after inital 2 hours of usage it looks awesome. I am not a gamer and focussed on mainly camera & storage and its totally worth it. I will give detailed feedback after using it for sometime. Also thanks to amzon for quick delivery.3k discount was the highlight since 30K looks slightly on expensive side. I already have started liking Color OS over MIUI.  Case you get with this phone is very premium. Earphone quality is also too good. Clicked few photo samples and it's more than what i had expected. Glad that i bought this phone .\n\n  \n"},
