Trust me this phone is a beast.Cons -Day 1 - No display issue noticed, did every testDay 2 - Black bar is visible in in Dark tone theme on chrome and lock screen.Day 3 - Screen flickering issue and colour retention issuesNote - You will never going to see any issues if you don't use Dark tone theme.Expert says Amoled display has limited life span but if you noticed issues from beginning then it is not a good sign it can be worse day by day. Specially if it has manufacturing defects.Price is 55k for the phone but it's not worth with this faulty display. Nobody has this much time to visit service center now and then. Even i tried to call customer service but my call is on wait for 1 hour no body picks up so who will be responsible for our device problems?If this display issues can be solved then they would have been solve it in past 2 months\n\n  \n"},

Black bar, black crush issue and red tint across the display. ( Attached photos for reference)2. Significant discoloration on display with uneven brightness. ( clearly visible in the photos)3. OnePlus has tried to dampen the issue by increasing the minimum brightness, now its uncomfortable to use in the dark, with so bright screen glaring at you. ( Trying to get away)Seems to be prominent in the Indian unit.No response from amazon or OnePlus till now. This is totally unacceptable. Your silence on this is shameful.For you it might be just another phone, For me it is hard earned money that they I have saved up for monthsHighly disheartened with this purchase.Request to Replace or Refund this purchase.\n\n  \n"},

Started seeing some black bars in lower dialer screen with default wallpaper and also in chrome browser. Front and rear camera really sucks. Camera seem to be ordinary as <15k budgeted phone. Battery is really utter waste thing with less usage it lasted for 4 hours. If someone is looking for great flagship. Never go for this. You will regret for the rest of your life. I was amazed by the youtube review videos about this phone. But it don't deserve to be a flagship phone. Most features are just a gmmick to attract customers. Green tint has not been fixed yet. Everyone who buys this. Please check it thoroughly by sliding brightness where you can see RGB tint. Am returning it for refund.CAUTION: Never buy this. If your are looking for a great camera and battery. Numbers seem to be awesome. But they are not up to the mark. This is my honest review on this. Rest is upto you.\n\n  \n"},

A horizontal bar appears on the top under the front camera notch. Green patches are visible under low brightness and 120Hz. This is a hardware issue. Please return your product if the same issue persists in your device too. Going for iPhone now\n\n  \n"},

OnePlus has been evading defect screening apparently, as I got a screen with dead pixels. You can see the black spot at the edge of the screen. Really disappointed with the OnePlus operations.\n\n  \n"}
