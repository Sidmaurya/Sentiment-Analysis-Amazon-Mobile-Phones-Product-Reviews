You can use a back cover for extra safety.B) The update of MUI 10 OS after unboxing have made the phone navigation more fluidic and easy to use.C) Touch response over screen is cool and finger print detection takes just fraction of second to unlock or activate any set of commands.D) Face Unlock feature in this price range is really a premium thing we can boast off and it works well without any delay.E) Camera clarity is above average and do justice to the megapixel it claims. The portrait mode adds blur and make a good picture if you are in a well lit environment, or else it simply blurs portion of the space around the subject.F) Though preset ringtones are similar in sounds, the clarity is well good to be noticed even in nosy environment.G) Thankfully the heating issue is completely absent on normal usage of the phone. Anyway gaming for more than 1.5 hours adds a little heat in time.H) Have been using the phone for almost three weeks now and it haven't hanged or crashed even for a single time.I) Have a bunch of MI apps which you may not use and hence its better to disable or uninstall them.J) Battery backup is really good and it will last for 1.5 days on moderate to heavy usage.K) Lacks fast charging feature and hence take almost 2 hours to get fully charged.L) The phone doesn't come with a headset and hence you have to buy it separately.M) In overall a good budget phone with latest features.If my review was really helpful for you in knowing more about the product , please click YES. Thank You\n\n  \n"},
