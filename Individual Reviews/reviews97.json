Its 16.15 cms display is quite impressive. Most of the time i watch movies while travelling to and from office . Hence I can have a better screen view now. The camera is also excellent.Overall a nice phone within a nominal budget. I\u2019ll give it a 5 stars for now.\n\n  \n"},

I was using MI note 6 and looking for something fresh bcz I was bored with it\u2019s UI. I explored the content available over internet and waited for it to buy after getting the right fitment against my requirement. I am so excited to share my personal experience after my early purchase of this device. I love taking pictures of mine and surrounding too. So great camera quality is one of my main priority, after using it now I must say that it has the best camera available in this budget.It\u2019s plastic made but mirror finish back panel is the coolest thing in my blue colour device. I also appreciate the makers for understanding our further need and offering the tempered glass and transparent back cover for device protection. Once you will keep the device handy it will give you a feel of it. With the brand tag line of Vivo \u201cCamera & Music\u201d it really impressed me.I\u2019ll surely recommend my fellow buyers to buy this cool device. But there is also something which can be improved so writing it in bullet points for your ease..Pros:-\u25cf It\u2019s really a 100% value for money device.\u25cf Run on latest version of Android \u201c9\u201d.\u25cf In Box soft back cover and tempered glass.\u25cf Dedicated kid mode for safety against unwanted operational activity of kids\u25cf Finger print sensor in back of the device is at perfectly placed in the reach of fingers and open the device faster.\u25cf 5000Ah battery, allows to watch many hours online video\u25cf HD+ screen Resolution and balanced colour contrast makes the viewing experience really pleasure and never hurt eyes\u25cf Triple camera with AI and image editing options are among the best features for me\u25cf Fast charging support with 18 watt inbox adaptor\u25cf Snapdragon 665 processor is really a power pack performer even in multitaskingCons:-\u25cf Lags in PubG (However in a device with 4 GB it\u2019s expected as the game itself take 2 GB space)\u25cf No headphones included\u25cf Front Camera struggles in low light.At the price of 10990 its a great phone for better multitasking. Vivo has finally started improving specs and is doing good with their phones in the segment.I hope my review helped you in making your right decision!\n\n  \n"},
