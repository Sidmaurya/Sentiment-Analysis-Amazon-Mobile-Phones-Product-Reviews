It's pro fades out its Con so can go for it blindly but only if you think \"CAMERA'S\" not your \"PRIORITY\"Features I thought would be there was 9.1 surround music/Dolby Atmos but it comes with:Real Sound Technology, just have a look into it if you're specific2. Super Amoled+ Display.Hassle free(Inside the box):Tempered glass comes on the phone itself so no extra work on fixing, which might sometimes go wrong.2. Silicon back case (if you're looking for touch and feel of leather back, better not use.. but use a side bumper if available for protection) Do also post where we can find side bumper, cos it's hard finding for new phones.. Thanks!Looking for a Standout design in 15-20k range? Then, \"GO FOR IT\" that's Value for money!\n\n  \n"},

Firstly thanks to Amazon. Got delivered at a lightning speed. Ordered ok Saturday. Launch date was on 21st September and got delivered the same day at morning.2. Now about Oppo 17, this is very light weight, speed is good, I ordered dynamic orange. Trust me, this is the best and attractive colour I found \u0964l, blue is a good option too if you don't like a funky coloir\u09643. Camera I did not found upto the mark . Night mode is not that great but yes if you are a selfie person, go for it. I was using Ralme Xt earlier and it's camera was much better. But ok I will manage . I am a part time photographer and often I use my phone to click pics. Realme supported me a lot. Let's see how much Oppo supports.4. Speed is good. 6 GB 128 GB. Good combo. No lagging till now. Going smooth.5. Touch is awesome. Phone gets unlocks quickly. No lagging here too .Rest I will use for some more days and come back with my reviews again.\n\n  \n"},

This is probably the fastest decision I have ever taken around buying a phone and I am hoping this will last long, like most of my other phones.\n\n  \n"},

Weight of the Phone is very less when compared to any phone in this segment and this matters a lot to me while carrying or casual music listening or any stuff.2. Back leather type wrapper is really good and gives a premium feel.3. UI is also good in terms of usage and mobile handling and compatibility4. Camera is decent for video calls/ normal phots not that great especially for shotting long-distance objects/ sceneries. But this doesn't matter to me a lot. Come on use a professional camera if you want photography at peaks.5. Design is excellent and it is the slimmest phone at 7.43mm6. Build Material quality is good.7. Sound is good but not that great for melodies or any songs please use earphones/headphones.8. Display is really good and it's out of my expectation as I'm using Samsung AMOLED previously.9. Processor is fast for general purpose and played COD and some other games at medium graphics didn't observe any lag.10. Battery is okay and keeps you charged up for one day (General usage with low- medium gaming)11. Software is fast and no clutter apps or extra apps.Overall I would definitely recommend if someone wants a nice phone for general usage which looks classy.\n\n  \n"},
