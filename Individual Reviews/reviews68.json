Camera quality is excellent in this price tag, cant expect more from Xiaomi.. Used realme devices also and i faced a lot of bugs in realme software, ads are ok for me in miui than facing bugs in colour os. Delivery is ontime with good packing by amazon.. Build quality of phone is good. Look wise its premium. Camerabump is more than i thought of. Highly recommended device in this price tag.\n\n  \n"},

The battery life is decent although could be better but it is backed up by fast charger so charging time has certainly reduced. The Ram and internal.storage as well are higher than what other competitors are offering for a product at this price point. Certainly good value for money.\n\n  \n"},

Best phone in comparison to Lenovo K8Note and other at par mobiles. 48 megapixel camera and UI graphics, Ram and storage is quite sufficient to operate Pubg as well as multiple apps simultaneously\n\n  \n"},
