If this is the quality if oppo wants to release in the market at this price range, better don't make audience feel awful with the products. I heard oppo and vivo got nice quality products in high price range, but this quality sucks.Cons: (in comparison with Redmi)UI is patheticScreen resolution is very badCamera (ofcourse didn't expect)Build is just okPerformance is worst ( touch screen issues) it's like I m using 10 years old phone.Bought it for parents who hardly use phone, but still even they didn't like it for the above reasons.\n\n  \n"},

There are severe problems between outgoing and incoming calls.The network is constantly 3g and under very small occurrences,does it come on 4g.The phone also sometimes severely freezes and lags and nothing can be opened for some minutes.I request you look into this matter and take proper steps of exchange of the mobile with a 4gb ram phone or in the price range of the above mentioned phone\n\n  \n"}
