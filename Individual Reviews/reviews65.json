Is this phone new?\n\n  \n"},

Performance is decent, back camera is quite good, front is just ok, good battery life, smooth experience with Android go. Go for it if your uses are minimal.\n\n  \n"},

The main fault of this phone is there is no gallery. Instead of gallery there is Google photos but it has limit\n\n  \n"},

Basically if your parents Or kids are using smart phones for the first time it's the best.I ordered it for my mother. She doesn't use any other app apart from WhatsApp. She finds it convenient to use. Battery life would have been better.\n\n  \n"}
