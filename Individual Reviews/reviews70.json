Its Kind of Bend. I have checked on internet and saw so many similar cases. It has to rectify while manufacturing itself. I have raised case replacement but the process is like painful. Technician will take 5 to 7 working days to visit you to see the issue, once he sends the report to seller then they will proceed for replacement. The whole process takes 20 days approx or even more it seems. Mean while I booked this via No cost EMI offer, Now that also getting affected like once you raise replacement case, the Initial contact with back will be terminated and  for that bank will charge some money it seems. And again new contract will be made for new order or replacement. Even though issue was from seller, customer also need to suffer. Its very Bad!!\n\n  \n"},

I have attached the pic of the box. This is ridiculous for cost cutting, they are reducing the in-box accessories. Overall phone is good with camera and performance.\n\n  \n"},
