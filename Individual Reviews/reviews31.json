Sometimes it over expose images. But I think it will be fixed in the future update. So no worries.Final Verdict: Go and grab it. 8GB + 128GB is good enough for moderate users.PS: people who are still waiting for \"pro\" just don't think about the price. There are lot of things which you will be bound to buy if you get pro model. (4000\u20b9) wireless charger, etc. So add that value also to the phone value.\n\n  \n"},

And I can say that One Plus has not lead us down again.The touch is super smooth, face unlock is fast as a blink of an eye, I constantly use google assistant which response pretty well, I am blown away with the camera quality and audio quality that is powered by Dolby Atmos.Apart from the strong base of hardware and software the phone has some pretty cool features that I have been loving for instance Digital Wellbeing, Work-Life Balance mode, Quick reply in landscape ,Zen Mode, customization for each application that helps in optimization and intelligent functioning.The phone connects pretty fast to wifi and Bluetooth devices. Does not lag or heat up. I have used this phone for my online meetings as well, the screen renders images and videos pretty well.All in all this a great deal and I highly recommend buying this phone.\n\n  \n"},

Its fantastic. I was confused between onyx black and Glacial Green but I think i made right decision.Glacial green is best color OnePlus ever made.If want to buy this device just go for it. You will not be disappointed\n\n  \n"},

Now return period has been over and i have no clue what to do with this garbage. It gets automatically turned off and troubles while turning on. I want a replacement if possible. I had put my previous money to buy it and now i have lost my trust in oneplus.\n\n  \n"},

First of all, I m not new to OP. I had OP6 earlier. I am writing this review after 10 days.Battery backup is not like Op6 (OP6 had better).My OP6 had some issues like disappearance of networks and rebooting again and again. I went to service centre they told me it's motherboard is failed. It ll take me Rs. 18000-20000 to get motherboard replaced. So I had to buy new one. Now after 3 days of use same issue happened in OP8 too, like disappearance of networks n power button wasn't working I had to use power button+ volume up+ volume down altogether to reboot it again which was highly disappointing and annoying too.Not only this when I play game at bottom of the screen I can see some disturbance too which u can c in screenshots and videos I uploaded with the review. There is no 3.5 mm jack if u don't want to switch to wireless headphones as I dn like to use wireless ones. I hv asked for replacement but it's been more than 24 hours I haven't received a single email after appointment with the technician. Yesterday I set it to full brightness to worship outside in sunlight and I received a prompt in phone about my phone's temperature So it has heating issues too. Go through the images n video n ull get to understand that y u shud wait for another version or look for another options. Highly disappointed with its performance. Thank you.Hope u ll find it helpful.\n\n  \n"},

Guys when you buy check all the features they seem to be shipping a lot of faulty sets.\n\n  \n"},
