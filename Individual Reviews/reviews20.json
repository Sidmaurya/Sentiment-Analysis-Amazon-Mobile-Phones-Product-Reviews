Asked for a return, but the delivery boy didn't take the return because the phone is dead! Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.\n\n  \n"},

So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.\n\n  \n"},

It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.\n\n  \n"},
