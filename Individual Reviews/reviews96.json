The Camera quality is fine and totally meets the expectation. The overall phone is nice but not strong enough to handle highly specified apps, like we can easily notice the lags while scrolling up/down in the YouTube trending and Instagram surfing threads. The frame rate has already been dropped. So, won't be able to access PUBG or COD not more than Low graphics and Medium FPS even the response is slower (as if playing Devil May Cry 4 in AMD Athlon processor attached PC)\n\n  \n"},
