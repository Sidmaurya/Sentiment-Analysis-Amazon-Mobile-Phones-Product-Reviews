THE MESSAGE SECTION OPERATION IS VERY BAD AND NOT USER FRIENDLY. IF U WANT DELETE ANY APPIT WILL GO TO GOOGLE ICON ALSO TIME CONSUMING FOR DELETION. NOT AT ALL A USER FRIENDLY OPERATION.FURTHER THE BATTERY WILL TAKE 5 TO 6 HOURS  FOR  FULL CHARGE AND GET VERY HOT AFTER 3 HRS PLUGGING . VERY DIFFICULT OPERATION FOR PHONE CLONING. NOT WORTH FOR MONEY..\n\n  \n"},

It is taking 1 hour to charge 20% battery. So effectively it is taking 5 hours for full charge.If you are thinking to purchase it then please drop your idea.Very disappointed.\n\n  \n"},
