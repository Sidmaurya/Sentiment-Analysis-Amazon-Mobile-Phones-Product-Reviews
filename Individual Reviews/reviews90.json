After using it for 7 day's I'm writing this review.1. I am not a gamer or don't run any app to consume high performance. I have the regular banking and social apps and default phone apps. Internal memory not consumed more then 20gb. Still this phone takes time to load home page. This is really ridiculous.2. Some modes in this phone are not working exactly upto the mark.  A. Dark mode - it will not change to dark mode by the time I select, May change when phone wishes to do. Viseversa if i would like deselect dark mode.  B. When loading - screen flickering occurs often in many common applications. GDrive, Gpay, whatsapp and opera browser.  C. Receivers are not seeing my face in whatsapp app video call, in duo its working fine. Only in my call receivers facing this issue.Camera I did not test much, but I didn't see any issues. Clarity is good.Finget scan is not fast compare to competitor phones.My overall rating is 1 for 5Complaint s registered with Amazon, Technician did not visit to inspect the phone. All the above complaints works randomly, I had screen recored and shots for proof to show.\n\n  \n"}
