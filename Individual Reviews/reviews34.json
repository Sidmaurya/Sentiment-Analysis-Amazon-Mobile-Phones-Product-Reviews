Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...Pros.1) good features considering cost 6800.2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt3) Speakers are good Dolby4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 68007) 5000mAh battery8) can be use as power bank for other phonesCons:1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...\n\n  \n"},

My friend bought the same mobile but that was 4 gb ram and 64 gb rom in which he got hand free but my mobile was 3 gb ram and 64 rom in which they are not providing hand free. Why?\n\n  \n"},

Gaaming is awesome , camera is not upto the mark, quad camera is just locha, night mode doesn't satisfy you,And the most important thing it lacks is the LED NOTIFICATION LIGHT it's a must and seeing it's price (13k) notification light must have arranged,I bought this phone in exchange don't buy it without exchange because you can get a much better phone in this price . nest with exchange\n\n  \n"},
